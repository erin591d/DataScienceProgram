    "- Python is an object-oriented programming language\n",
    "- Every value in Python is an object\n",
    "- Objects are a way to combine data and the functions that handle that data\n",
    "- This combination is called encapsulation\n",
    "- The data items and functions of objects are called attributes, and in particular, the function attributes are called methods\n",
    "- For example, the operator + on integers calls a method of integers, and the operator + on strings calls a method of strings\n",
    "- Functions, modules, methods, classes, etc. are all first class objects\n",
    "    - This means that these objects can be:\n",
    "        - Stored in a container\n",
    "        - Passed to a function as a parameter\n",
    "        - Returned by a function\n",
    "        - Bound to a variable\n",
    "- One can access an attribute of an object using the dot operator: object.attribute\n",
    "- For example, if L is a list, we can refer to the method append with L.append\n",
    "    - The method call can look, for instance, like this: L.append(4)\n",
    "- Because modules are also objects in Python, we can interpret the expression math.pi as accessing the data attribute pi of module object math\n",
    "- Numbers like 2 and 100 are instances of type int\n",
    "    - Similarly, \"hello\" is an instance of type str\n",
    "    - When we write s=set(), we are actually creating a new instance of type set, and bind the resulting instance object to s\n",
    "- A user can define his own data types\n",
    "    - These are called classes\n",
    "- A user can call these classes like they were functions, and they return a new instance object of that type\n",
    "- Classes can be thought of as recipes for creating objects\n",
