    "My name is Erin McConnell and I am a senior Applied Math and Statistics double major at the University of Connecticut. I am planning on applying to graduate school for Data Science in the upcoming semester and hopefully pursue a career in the Data Science field as well. I currently live in Sarasota, Florida, but I grew up in Bermuda where I lived for 11 years. Some of my hobbies include reading, dancing, singing, playing the piano, and working out. I also have a miniature labradoodle named Popcorn! \n",

    "To me, Data Science is the analysis of groups of data and conveying those analyses to the general public to help people better understand a certain topic or question. I'm the type of person who likes to help others and if I can use my skills in Data Science to help others understand complex issues that they normally wouldn't, I would be where I want to be in life."
